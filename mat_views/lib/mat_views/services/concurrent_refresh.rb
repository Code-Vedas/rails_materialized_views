    # Refresh service that runs:
    #
    #   `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY <schema>.<rel>`
    #
    # It keeps the view readable during refresh, but **requires at least one
    # UNIQUE index** on the materialised view (a PostgreSQL constraint).
    #
    # Options:
    # - `row_count_strategy:` (Symbol, default: :none) â†’ one of `:estimated`, `:exact`, or `:none or nil` to control row count reporting
    #
    # Returns a {MatViews::ServiceResponse}
    #
    # @see MatViews::Services::RegularRefresh
    # @see MatViews::Services::SwapRefresh
    #
    # @example Direct usage
    #   svc = MatViews::Services::ConcurrentRefresh.new(definition, **options)
    #   response = svc.call
    #   response.success? # => true/false
    #
    # @example via job, this is the typical usage and will create a run record in the DB
    #   When definition.refresh_strategy == "concurrent"

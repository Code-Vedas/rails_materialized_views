# Become a contributor

We welcome contributions from the community to help improve and enhance this project. Whether you're fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving documentation, your contributions are valuable!

## How to contribute

Generally, most of your contributions can be made using standard GitHub workflows:

1. **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
      git clone <your-forked-repo-url>
      cd rails_materialized_views
      git checkout -b <your-feature-branch> # or any other branch name
   ```

3. **Make Changes:** Make your changes in the codebase. Ensure you follow the coding standards and conventions used in the project.
4. **Test Your Changes:** Run the test suite to ensure your changes do not break any existing functionality.

   ```bash
   bundle install
   bin/rspec # Run all tests
   bin/rubocop # Check code style
   ```

5. **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message.

   ```bash
      git add .
      git commit -m "feat: Add a clear and descriptive commit message"
   ```

6. **Push to Your Fork:** Push your changes to your forked repository.

   ```bash
      git push origin <your-feature-branch>
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request:** Go to the original repository and create a pull request from your forked branch. Provide a clear description of the changes you made and why they are necessary.
8. **Address Feedback:** Be responsive to any feedback or requests for changes from the maintainers.
9. **Celebrate Your Contribution:** Once your pull request is merged, celebrate your contribution to the project!

### FAQs

#### What's the screening process to become a member?

We review your past contributions, expertise, and alignment with the project's goals. The screening process may include an interview or discussion to understand your motivations and how you can contribute effectively.
There is no fixed process, and yes-we do not ask you to code anything for screening, or sit through lengthy interviews. We believe in simplicity and meritocracy.

#### Are there any membership fees?

Of course not! There are no fees to become a member. The project is open source and always will be.

#### Do I get paid for my contributions?

No, contributions are voluntary and unpaid. However, we do recognize and appreciate the efforts of our contributors through acknowledgments in the project documentation and release notes.

#### What are the expectations from members?

There are no strict expectations, but we encourage members to actively contribute, participate in discussions, and help maintain the quality of the project. We appreciate your time and effort in making this project better!
That said, we do run occasional cleanup drives to remove inactive members.

#### How can I leave the membership?

You can leave the membership at any time using GitHub’s standard option to remove yourself from the repository. We’d appreciate it if you could inform us before leaving.

#### Do I need to be an expert in Rails or PostgreSQL to contribute?

Not at all! While expertise helps, there are plenty of ways to contribute even if you’re new-improving documentation, writing tests, fixing small issues, or just reporting bugs.

#### Can I propose new features?

Yes, please! Open a Feature Request issue with details about your idea, why it’s useful, and any suggested implementation. We encourage brainstorming and collaborative discussions.

#### What if I break something with my contribution?

Don’t worry-it happens! That’s why we have reviews, tests, and CI. Maintainers will help guide fixes. Mistakes are part of learning, and we’re here to support you.

#### Can I work on more than one issue at a time?

Yes, but we recommend focusing on one issue at a time to keep things manageable and avoid conflicts. If you want to take multiple, please mention it in the issue thread so maintainers are aware.

#### How will my contributions be recognized?

Your name will appear in commit history, pull requests, and release notes. Active and consistent contributors may also be added as repository members for direct access.

#### What communication channels are available?

We use GitHub Issues and Pull Requests for technical discussions. Members also get access to our Slack workspace for faster collaboration and community interaction.

#### Is there a roadmap I can follow?

Yes! Check the GitHub Issues board and project milestones for upcoming work. You can also ask maintainers if you’d like to align your contributions with our roadmap.

#### Can companies or organizations contribute?

Yes, absolutely. While membership is personal, organizations can contribute via pull requests, sponsor the project, or collaborate with us for features that align with their use cases.
